## 1. Implementation

### User Management

- **Endpoints:** `POST /users`, `GET /users`, `GET /users/{id}`, `PUT /users/{id}`, `DELETE /users/{id}`
- Users can be created and retrieved dynamically.
- Each user has a unique `id`, `username`, and `email`.

### Poll Management

- **Endpoints:** `POST /polls`, `GET /polls`, `GET /polls/{id}`, `PUT /polls/{id}`, `DELETE /polls/{id}`
- Each poll has a question, expiration date, and the username of the creator.

### Vote Options

- **Endpoints:** `POST /polls/{pollId}/options`, `GET /polls/{pollId}/options`, `PUT /polls/{pollId}/options/{optionId}`
- Multiple options can be added to a poll and ordered with `presentationOrder`.
- Vote options are automatically removed when the poll is deleted.

### Voting

- **Endpoints:** `POST /polls/{pollId}/votes`, `GET /polls/{pollId}/votes`, `PUT /polls/{pollId}/votes/{voteId}`
- Users can vote on a poll, change their vote, and retrieve votes for a poll.
- Votes are automatically removed when the poll is deleted.

## 2. Test Scenarios

Following a test-driven approach, the following scenario is fully implemented and tested:

1. Create a new user
2. List all users -> shows the newly created user
3. Create another user
4. List all users again -> shows two users
5. User 1 creates a new poll
6. List polls -> shows the new poll
7. User 2 votes on the poll
8. User 2 changes his vote
9. List votes -> shows the most recent vote for User 2
10. Delete the one poll
11. List votes -> empty

All scenarios are implemented in `Assignment2ApplicationTests.java` and pass successfully.

## 3. Technical Issues Encountered

- **Cross-test dependencies:** Tried to split the "flow" into multiple test methods, which caused problems related to objects created in just one test (e.g., a user or poll) that was not accessible in the other tests. The solution was simply to use one comprehensive integration test that simulates the entire scenario from user creation to poll deletion, even though it might not be the best practice.
- **Vote deletion:** Ensuring cascade deletion required attention to JPA mappings. Verified via integration tests.

## 4. Pending Issues

- OpenAPI documentation (`@Operation` annotations) was considered but deferred for simplicity.  
- No authentication/authorization is implemented; all endpoints are open.

---

## 5. Notes

- All tests are located in `src/test/kotlin/no/hvl/dat250/assignment2/Assignment2ApplicationTests.kt`.  
- The application runs on a random port during tests (`@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)`), and URLs are dynamically constructed.  
- Gradle is used for building and test automation, including a GitHub Actions workflow.
